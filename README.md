# Walmart Node.js Microservice Kit

A robust and scalable template for building Node.js microservices, designed with best practices for rapid development in enterprise environments.
## Description

This repository provides a foundational template to jumpstart a Node.js microservice architecture tailored for enterprise-grade applications.  
The goal is to streamline the creation of independent services that communicate seamlessly via APIs — reducing boilerplate, enforcing a standard project structure, and making it easier to deploy, maintain, and scale.

## Features

- Microservice architecture — scaffold for building independent, modular services  
- Docker-friendly setup — ready for containerization and orchestration  
- Structure for routing, controllers, services, and models — keeps code organized and maintainable  
- Sample setup for environment configuration for easy deployment across environments  
- Optional support for database, external integrations, and environment-based configs  
- (Optional) Example testing suite configuration — adaptable to your preferred test framework

- [npm] (or Yarn, if you use it)  
- [Docker] (if you plan to use Docker for containerization)  
- A database engine (if your service requires one — e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, as configured)
